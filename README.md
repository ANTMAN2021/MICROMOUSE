# MICROMOUSE
As a Team Robotics projects, this is a stm32 based micromouse.
There are two pcbs, one based on stm32f103c8t6 and other on stm32f405rgt6.
The assembled bot is on stm32f103 bluepill.
Motor driver used is DRV8833 and sensors are IR sensors.
N20 motors with encoders are used.
Basic running code is given above, shortest path algorithm is in progress.
